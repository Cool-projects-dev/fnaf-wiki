          <p>
            Release Date: August 8, 2014</p>
<p>Developer: Scott Cawthon</p>
<p>Engine: Clickteam Fusion 2.5 </p>

<p>Platform(s): PC, Mobile, Console (later ports)

<h3>
🧠 Overview</h3>
<p> Five Nights at Freddy’s is the first game in the popular indie horror franchise. Players take the role of Mike Schmidt, a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, a family restaurant with animatronic characters that become dangerously active after hours.
</p>
<p>The game is set in a single room—the security office—where players must survive five nights (and more) using limited resources to monitor and defend against hostile animatronics.
</p>
<h3>🎮 Gameplay</h3>
<p>Players must monitor a network of security cameras to track animatronics and prevent them from entering the office.
</p>
<p> Defensive tools include:</p>
<li>Door controls (left and right)</li>
<li>Hallway lights</li>
<li>Security cameras</li>


<p>All tools drain limited power, which resets each night. If power runs out, the office goes dark and Freddy Fazbear will attack.
</p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<li>Survive from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM each night
</li>
<li>Avoid being caught by any animatronic
</li>
<li>Manage power usage effectively</li>

</p>

<li>A man later known as the Purple Guy is responsible</li>
<li>The infamous “Bite of ’87” is mentioned, involving severe injury caused by an animatronic</li>
<li>Missing children incident posters can be spotted in the game</li>
